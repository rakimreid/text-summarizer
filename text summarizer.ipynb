      "But you worked so hard at it in high school. Sakurai. Oh yeah. Right. Wow. Sakurai. Sakurai. Well, I called you over and over but you weren't hearing me. Oh, okay. Oh, nothing. Oh man, that's too bad. My friends and I actually already ate, but if you insist I could always come along to keep you company and watch you eat. Yikes. Well, as it turns out, I'm suddenly available this afternoon too. I know you tended to default to being a loner, but come on, two has gotta be way more fun than one. Hey, that's right. What? No. Forget it. Come on. No. Ugh. Huh? Okay, fine. Come on, let's go. Sure. Right? Sure. Seriously. Yeah. Okay. Oh, that's a fair point. Okay. Right? I get it. I do. Honestly, I knew I shouldn't have brought you. Huh? Finally, I haven't been able to pick which movie to see with you all up in my business. Hold on. Yes. If there's one you wanna see, I'll pay. Really? Thanks. I mean it's heroes as far as the eye can see, so we really can't lose. Oh yeah, that's a great one. I saw it once, but I was thinking of seeing it again. Oh cool. She seems happy though, so I guess I can do this much. Hey, by the way, it's interesting that you've apparently seen enough solo movies to pay for someone else's ticket. Yeah, A good film's is always worth of rewatch. Yeah, sure. Whoa. Sakurai. Yeah. Look, you gotta check this out. That's correct. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Go. Okay. I mean, I get it, but when you, you know like that. I would buy this in a second if I had the money, it's just, Oh well. So good. Hey, I think it's time to go. Hey. Whoa. Yes, please. Thank you. Oh, okay. Okay. Shut up. Whoa. It's,\n",

      "Oh crap. It's, it's totally. What's this? Wow. I've never thought much of VR, but this was pretty cool. Hey, you said VR made you wanna do something physical and now all you're doing is swinging that bat looking stupid and racking up a pile of strikes. You said you'd done this before, but you totally haven't. Fine. Thanks. Okay. Yeah. Dummy. But before any of that, I wanna go get dinner. Geez. No. That's right. Mm-hmm. All right. Hold on. Huh? Yeah. Wow. Oh no. Ah, yeah, I guess you're right. Here you go. Hmm. Sakurai. What? Come on. Right. Oh, look at you pretending you're not happy. I can't. Aw. Hmm. Phrasing. Slow jazz played at a moderate volume, warm, indirect lighting, and of course the soothing aroma of coffee. Ever since I opened this cafe, I've tried to create the perfect ambiance. Huh? Whoa. When you've been running a place for a decade, You just know Sakurai started working at the cafe last year, Next time. Thank you. Sure. He looks like a tough guy, but he's attentive and understands how I run the place. That's the first time I've heard Sakurai shout, and it's such a volume. Nice. Anyway, I was hungry, so I figured I'd go for a quick snack. Get out. This may be where I work part-time, but it's also a place to relax. Ugh. What? Hi. Shut up. Wait. Huh? Now, customer, I find it hard to believe this is how you always act at work. Oh, I'm a top-notch waiter. Get out. Yeah, because if I did take this seriously, you'd never stop making fun of me. To be honest, it's sort of embarrassing when people I know see me playing the nice waiter. But this is so close to campus that people you know, must drop by on the regular. Oh. Sakurai. Fun. Here we go. Nope. I'm sorry, I can't control myself. No problem. What? Oh yeah. Yep. I agree. Hey, I know. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Oh, wouldn't that be the best. Stop. Calm down. Pathetic. Oh, hey, it's you. It's not running away, so I thought I could pet it. Aw. Yeah, sure. Well, I can see you're trying, but it's obvious you're a total beginner when it comes to animals. See, it couldn't be simpler when they're used to people. Yeah, sure. Whoa. Really? Oh. Cats hate high pitch noises like that, but if it lives around here, you'll see the kitty again. All right, let's get to class. Woohoo. Really? Oh man. Oh. Oh crap. Sorry. My bad. It's just I could see your panties, so I tried to help you out. Wait. Whatever. Whoa. Stop. My clothes are snagged, so there's a pretty high chance my boobs will pop out. If you keep going, please don't say the B word. Really? Oh yes. Wow. Okay. I wasn't sure how that was gonna go, but you nailed the assist. Come on. Huh? Huh? Too bad. I know you're lonely, but please don't cry. Oh man. I should probably go introduce myself to this angel, huh. Mm-hmm. Oops. Thanks so much. It's uh, coming along. Sakurai. Hi there. Huh? Yeah. No. What? laugh\n",

      "It's a very kind gesture, but you really didn't have to do that. Okay. Interesting. Uh, I've been meaning to ask you something. Absolutely not. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Huh? Well, since it's so convenient, I figure I could sleep. No way. But for a girl to stay the night, that's a whole other thing. Huh? You dummy. Moron. I opened this cafe to get a glimpse into different sorts of lives and relationships, but these two are the best. He looks a little scary, but he takes his work seriously and our regulars only have good things to say about him, but most of all, that boy is fine. Look at him. He looks thin, but he's got some real muscles under there. Uh, I doubt he's even noticed this, but he has plenty of fans around here. Well, that's impressive. Yes. I mean, you can see everything. Huh? Hm. Okay. I will. Sakurai. Hey. Well, I could ask you the same thing. Wait, what? Yeah. All right. Ugh. Thanks. Uh, she's in college. Cool. I thought it was an entirely different game, but when I found out it was kind of a sequel to the last one, it was like goosebump city. Oh yeah. Right? I mean, I would've been happy playing just a plain old building game, but it turned out to be such a crazy good find. What's this? It's nothing, pumpkin. I appreciate it. Hana Uzaki. So she's got this adorable baby animal vibe, but she's definitely not a baby. Oh yeah. Even now in college, he's got no better. Ah, so that's how it is. Oh, well just call me over whenever you're ready to order, Hana. 'Kay. What do you think? I know you wanna stick your nose in their business, but I feel like we really shouldn't interfere. You know, it's just hard not to want to guide them along a bit. I agree. Uh, here's your water, Uzaki. That's cold. Oh, don't gimme that crap. No. What? Yep. Oh yeah. And I don't get it why doesn't, why she have a cold then in that case. Oh, Uzaki. What? Hey. Yeah, Well, looks like I've let it in my place after all. No. No. Well, right then don't worry. Uh, this one's probably best for his symptoms. Then try to eat, even if it's just a few bites. It's good. Well, honestly, I'm not tasting things very well right now, but it's probably good. Huh? Sorry. Thanks. Excellent. No way. It's fine. Okay, here's your medicine. If you take this, you should be all better in the morning, but if you're still feeling awful tomorrow, make sure you go see a doctor. Got it. Yep. Wow. laugh \n",

      "Yeah. Come on. Hmm. If you'll just go, I can't go home a loser. Sakurai. Yeah. Thanks. Oh, it's fine. Hey, why don't I take one of your shifts soon. Huh? To health. To health. Yeah. Thanks guys. All right. Yeah. Especially when paired with good eats, the right flavors can change the entire palate of a meal. Now that that's settled, it's for you to eat up. Thanks. Well, don't, I'm just happy Hana was able to take such good care of you. Okay. Stop. And just so you know, it's not like that with me and Uzaki. No, it's really not. Besides Uzaki may be a trusted friend in all, but she's still a girl. Right? It's like coffee Ami slowly roasted, painstakingly brewed. Huh? That's right. Yeah, sure thing on. Huh? Thanks. Sure. Okay. Huh? Come on. Wait. That's for sure. Seriously. I don't know what she's after with this, but she did take care of me before. All right. Okay, let's do this. Here we go. Huh? Ha. Nope, that's not it. Hana. Again. Hana. Again. Hana. Hana. Hana. Wow. Afraid not, but if that's all it takes to make her happy,\n",

      "Yeah, it's fine. Come on. Uzaki. Look. I already told you I wasn't hypnotized. I already told you I wasn't hypnotized. Yep. Before I forget, we'll be taking a family trip to a hot spring over Golden Week. It wasn't a bad suggestion, but yeah. No way. Here goes. There you are. What's up. I knew you were off work, so I figured a loner like you would be home gaming rather than taking a big day and look, I was right. Awesome. Good for you. So anyways, I decided to take pity on you and come by to hang out so you won't be alone on a holiday. Go. Okay. Excellent. Ha. Oh. I mean, it's one thing to be all scowling, but walking around in public with that face, you'll get reported. Hey, you sure seem to be catching a lot of dull gorillas. Huh? Hello. Welcome. Sure thing. Yeah. All right. Yeah. Interesting. Hmm. Okay. Totally. Now that I think about it, you should probably wear these at work and school too. Oh, shut up. So good. Okay. laugh\n",

Good, but this game, the more people there are around you, the higher the monster spawn rate. Here. You have a thing for gorillas, don't you. Well, it doesn't matter either way. All right. There it is. Oops. Oh man. Sorry. It's okay. And at this rate, it's gonna get worse. Crap. Calm down. Yeah, It's nothing. Sakurai. We're gonna look back on this and laugh together someday, I think. Well, that was something. Cool. Oh, looks like I've missed about a million calls from Uzaki. Yeah. Okay. What? Well, I don't think you should worry too much about what happened between you. Right? I'm not. Hold on. What? I'm sorry. Wow. Whatever. I don't know what's up, but I will not engage too much trouble. No, she's engaging me. Did something happen, I looked at the calendar and it hit me. What? You know, besides I get so depressed thinking about this crappy weather sticking around for a whole nother month. Now. Look, you gotta calm down because I can't make heads or tails of this conversation. If the weekend doesn't work for you, then nevermind. What's up? Hey, this is gonna be awesome. Yeah. Yeah. What? Nope. Oh, come on. 'Kay. But -\n",

I know you don't have any good cookware here, so I've decided I'm gonna give you my old pot. Wow. Yeah. What's up? Hmm. Come on, let's work together to build something totally out there. Hm. It did get torn down a few times, but we'll work on it the next time you're over. Next time. Really? What? Huh? Hey. Okay. I will. Yes. It's a total must-\n",

Don't worry, I'm coming to get you. Okay. Crap. No. Whoa. That hasn't happened in a while. Seriously. Okay. Oops. My bad. Don't worry. I hope you know, you can tell me anything. Would you shut up. It's also common to dream of falling when one is in very high spirits, you may be getting carried away. It can also be --\n",

Wow. Nope. Nothing. Stop. There it is. Shut up. Hey, Sakurai. Huh? There you are. Wait, this person be no way. Yeah, that's right. What? Gotta be honest though, I definitely thought he was imaginary. Thank goodness. All right. Hi there. Hana Uzaki. Listen, I don't want you to worry. Huh? If you're always hanging out with your one male friend, people are definitely gonna talk. Come on. What? I'm not. Uh, That's class. See ya. I guess. Hey, don't worry, I get you. Oh, that's great. Oh, this summer is gonna be so lit. She's right. Huh? No. Not at all. Not at all. No. No, it's fine. So if you don't know, I guess it doesn't count. It's okay. Ah, shut up. Sorry. The thing is, in all these years I've never heard any romantic tales about Saku before. That's all. Uzaki. Come on, let's go grab some ice cream. Really? Hmm. What's up. Teasing those two is one thing, but come on. Well, I'm looking after those two and I won't let anyone shove them off course. I get it. No way. Geez. Here you go. Come on. Hmm. Oh yeah. I've just always heard it's like, I mean the flavor. Huh? Huh? Wait, what? I seriously, I was just wondering if Choco mint was good cuz it sounds like toothpaste to me. You suck. And it started when you compared it to toothpaste because for some reason, even though it's your garbage palate's fault, you can't eat choco mint you cowards are always so quick to slam the mint. The sheer arrogance of those people who think it's actually okay to persecute whatever they don't understand. That's right. Wow. Thank you very much. Oh yeah. I think everyone's free to hate what they want, but don't dis what someone else likes. To be fair, that was just because I never dreamed that you could possibly be one of those lower life forms. Well, it's not that I hate it. So anything with that cooling sensation, gum, cough drops forget it. But the cooling sensation's the best part, with the sweet chocolate chaser. Anyway, since I can't seem to do mint, uh, I'll admit I haven't tried choco mint. You're one of them, those who dare to mock choco mint and not taste it like utter fools. All right. I'm sorry. I get it. I mean, it's not like you're a child anymore, so they do say your sense of taste changes as you grow up. Maybe. I don't know. Here goes. Great. Now her silliness is rubbing off on me, but if I don't eat this now, it'll turn into a whole thing again. Ah. Oh. It's actually tasty, I'd say. That's kind of a vague answer, but at least you did manage to try it. Huh? I'm sorry. Nothing. Forget it. Now. Look, you'll take a thousand years for them to get together on their own. Yeah. Yes, please. In fact, it was right here in this cafe. Real talk. Listen, I understand you don't think Hana should be here, but she's here because she needs a job. Fine, let's get started then. Mm-hmm. Here. Next you'll say, please feel free to let me know whenever you're ready to order. Got it. I'm just saying if this act is going on forever, you should really toss in a joke. Oh, we've actually been training her on all this stuff since before you got in today. Great. Thanks. Come again. Huh? What? Huh. You're right. Huh? Seriously. Hey Hana. Come on. I can't. Thanks. I know. No. Huh? Right. Wait a minute. Come on. Typical. Hold on. You don't need your goggles at the beach, let alone a little swim cap. Oh, didn't know. See, it's like I told you before. That's right. Also, what were you thinking leaving Hana behind to go and swim by yourself. Huh? Mm-hmm. What? Yes. Right? Now. No. Nothing. What do you think? Yeah. Awesome. Thank you. Yep. Okay. Fine. Right? Okay. Hang on. Saku. Right? Sure. Ready. It's not far up, down, left, right, B. Seriously. No, no. Listen. Come on. Anyway, you're gonna tell me where to go. Man. Huh? Nothing. Huh? Hmm. Welcome. I knew you had a summer home, but I didn't know it was like. Whoa. Wow. Stop it. Look, it's one of those click pull things. Wow. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Huh? Ah, then it's a showdown. No way. Right? Okay. I know it's a little cliche, but it's really not summer without a courage test. Let's do it. I'm done. No way. 'Sup, saku you not into this kind of thing. No, it's just I don't play horror games. Uh, that's okay man. I'm sorry. I mean it. See ya. No. Sakurai, don't let go I am scared. Huh? Yeah, that's right. I knew it. But since almost every move those two make is an unexpected one, they may not go so well. Huh? Good question. Uh, Saku's actually a really great guy, but he's quiet and awkward and bad at making friends. And yes, I'm aware it's not my business, but I can't help it. I just wish his college life could be more fun, you know, otherwise it's kind of a waste. Okay. Huh? Okay. Come on. Yeah. Sakurai. Huh? Sure. Hang on. Huh? Nice. Wait, what? What? Uh. Sakurai. I know this is out of the blue, but...\n",

Thank you very much. Please come again. You're right. Oh, that's right. Sakurai. Huh? I know we couldn't give you very much in the way of advice, but I sure hope she was happy with whatever you chose. Actually, we both did, which wasn't very smart. Continue. Continue. So, and maybe it's because we were both tipsy, but to make a long story short, she ended up spending the night over at my place. Yes. Wow. Crap. Right? Hmm. Interesting. No way. Oh, come on. Nope, it's too good. I guess. Fine. Yes. She could put on a happy face, but she's changing things up this time. Here. But look, you are going, you're gonna spout dumb stuff like you smile is as bright as a firework or you're beautiful from every angle too just like these fricking fireworks. Hold on.

She'd only just pounced back and now this, not that I can see it, but I bet she's making that face again. Yeah, it's the same face she made back then too. It's like Ami and her dad said she's thinking about the way things look, but when it's her making that face, I guess it's only natural that things would feel a little off. Uzaki. Listen. Hmm.

I hate to say it, but it's probably a hundred percent thanks to you that I've been able to get used to being social and stuff. Sakurai. Good. Yeah. Right? Oh, I just don't know. I swear. Wow, that's a big age difference. Listen, Mr. Upstanding guy, I get that you wanna return what I paid you for the mess I made, but my mom's already said you don't have to. Stop. If you won't take it, then I'll just have to return it directly. That's correct. Anyway, you act like you're walking into a haunted house. Don't worry, we'll get gobbled up or anything. Wow. Yeah. Okay here we're, don't worry. Anyway, you're very welcome here. His eyes are so fierce. What? Okay. You're saying that Hana offered too much money for the futon, so you wanna give back the rest. I tried to give it to Hana, but she wouldn't take it. I hate to barge in on you, but returning it directly was the right thing to do. Huh? What's up? You know, that's not the point. But Sakurai's still, well he's, you know. Oh no. Don't say that, but yes, please do continue. Sakurai. Really? No, I wouldn't say that's exactly true. You suck. Goodness. Oh, that worry for nothing. Well, not at me, at my chest, his eyes are fixed on this one spot. Sakurai. Before you know it, she's gonna end up chasing you down. Absolutely not. Not gonna fly today, but soon I wanna hold her. Now that we've settled things, yes, I'll get going. What? Yeah. Sure. Whatever. Okay. Wow. Thanks so much. Come again. No, no. Oh wow. Totally. Oh my gosh. Of course. Wow, that's fantastic. Yep. Full disclosure, here's one more notable factor that tends to bring in moms like them on the regular. Mm-hmm. Yes. Of course. His eyes are fierce at first, but once you're past that, he's a hotty. I mean, he's tall, slim, and fit with a nice personality and good manners. I guess when you put it like that, he does seem like a catch.

      "in this shot and you are so cute, Niomi. Japan's oldest circular school building, originally a primary school. Huh? What? Yes. Sakurai, wanna buy me something as a souvenir. They look like four sisters, so I don't wanna separate them. Oh, come on. Okay. Wait, now it's my treat. Oh, that's great. Good for you. Oh, come on. Fine. All right. Here goes. Listen, I can't eat like this. Would you shut up. Oh yeah. Huh? Right? Yes. What do you think? It's not a competition, but I mean sure. Huh? Who, don't tell me, is this shrine, Hakuto shrine couples. So to honor Japan's first love story, Hakuto is a matchmaking shrine. And Tottori is home to two more sites, both variable meccas for lovers, one's on par with Hakuto Shrine. Yes. No, I mean people totally did think you are a couple. Pathetic. It's a destination for all seasons with beautiful autumn colors and magical, snowy winter landscapes. Also, it's a perfect spot for young lovers. Oh, it's almost our turn. Huh? Huh? I agree. Man. That's all. Good. Okay. Yeah. See, it's written using the characters three and morning. Yep. Look, I've already told you it's not like that with us. Hey. I'm not. Whatever. Okay. Here at Hot Spring, the waters are for soaking drinking and breathing in deeply. Oh cool. Better get breathing then, by the way. Shut up. Oh wow. I don't know. What? laugh \n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, this is great. Man. I was soaking wet, but not that I wouldn't even let it use this towel to deterred. Ah, shut up. What? Gotcha. All right. Hey, why don't you put those extra balls in this box. Thanks. I appreciate it. Sure thing. Come on. Well, you better make it snappy or you're gonna lose Mr.\n",
      "\n",
      "You're a tyrant. Oh, that's alright. So good. Sakurai. What's this? Let's see. What's this? Okay, you get, what's this Yeti stuff. Yep. Hey, there's my name for once. Great. Bye. Whatever. I'm done. See, it's a frog. It's too big, there's a little frog too. Oh. Geez. Sorry. No. Fine. Yes, you win the beanbag makes sense that it can stay, but the rest, this is a big problem. Ugh. Ah. Fine. Nope. Now. Nope. Yeah. I don't care. Besides, you know, you only left it here because you didn't need it. Great. Here we go. Like how you bought all those extra phone chargers, you just don't think before you do things. Yep. Sorry. Oh, I'm thirsty. No way. Huh? Uzaki. It's been a while, so it seemed like a fun idea. Sorry. Yeah. Well, I'm enjoying this. Man, he's so easy. Hey, Sakurai. Yeah. Listen, I know you don't think I can do this, okay. Oh wow. It's uh, really interesting. Yeah. I'm sorry. Stop it. Yes. Man. Yeah. Sorry. He doesn't have the tools so I told him he could come here and besides mom, you are my cooking instructor. All right, let's do it. Hey Hana. It's okay, I get it all the time. Well you know, I'm sorry though for Hana's nasty mouth. Wow. Oh, it's great. Thank you. Sakurai. It's fine. Go ahead. I don't know. Yes. Fine. Maybe I am scared, but it's not like that. Sure he was right next to me, but I wasn't looking at him like that. Oh, I think I should be more of a gentleman. I thought I was warming up to all of this, but I do not understand kids these days. Right? I know. Sure thing. Yes. Most pickup sports are things like baseball and Frisbee golf, but rock climbing strengthens your entire body at once, which is a good thing. Phrasing. Label G, that's the same color. What do you think? That was a blast. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Well, honestly, I'm not sure if this is for me. Well, yeah. Burpees, mountain climbers\n",

      "\n",
      "You're just mad cuz you thought you could one up me in here and got spanked. Ah. Oh, I see you're still rearing to go. All right, I'm really starting to enjoy this. Oh crap. Yeah. Fun. Shut up. Geez. Please. Come on. I mean it. You look like you did back in high school, Sakurai. Oh yes. Sakurai. Come on. Look at him. Typical. Yeah. I'm sorry. Thanks so much. It's adherence are growing in number, however, traditionally karaoke has been considered a group activity. So if you're spotted going solo, odds are you'll be teased relentlessly at school or work the following day. And yet compared to the utter shame of being unable to carry a tune in front of your friends compared to the embarrassment of bombing the rap section, such treatment is nothing. Look, I know that we go to the same college and yeah, sure we may all work together too, but I don't care. Listen, let's make it up to Sakurai. Thanks. Sakurai. Oh, it's our way of apologizing. It's not about liking it or disliking it, it's just that, please, I'm begging you spare me. Hang on. Okay, fine. Oh, see, this is what I like most about Sakurai. Great. Thanks. Not at all. Go ahead. Okay, that's fine. Hey, Sakurai tell us what your favorite coplay of evening was. Hello. Okay. No, wait, I didn't mean. Oh, come on. Uzaki. Hey, about yesterday when I said that bunny girl thing. Wait, calm down and tell me what's going on. Okay. I would, but I don't wanna be a bother. If there's any way I can help out, I will. Maybe. As it turns out, I haven't even touched that big report I had for homework over the summer break and now I'm totally screwed. No way. For real. Interesting. Come on. That hasn't happened in a while. Yes. Right. I do. Yep. Oh, thank you. Oh, it's good. Okay. laugh\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, it's true. Hana. Huh? It's nothing. Oh no. The funny thing is, we actually only started hanging out a little while after we started college. What? Please. Uh, I'll have to think about it. Got it. Got it. Okay. Morning. Uh oh. Hey Sakurai. Look, we've got two new first year managers joining us. Yeah, that's something. Cool. See ya. His eyes are so fierce. Huh? Sakurai. Thanks. Huh? Yeah. Huh? Wait a minute. Uh. Sorry. Huh? Bye. That's personal, alright. That's for sure. No, I just hate that he's seen my booze related humiliations. Since he's gone, we can't let it go to waste. Okay. Famous last words, but I guess you can't cause too much trouble. Woohoo. Thanks. I can't wait. Oh no. Yep. What? Okay. Yeah. So he rarely drinks when he is out, which means he's more likely to lower his guard at his place. Oh. And since Saku tends to keep pace with whoever he's with, if you are drinking, he'll naturally keep drinking too. Thanks. When Saku's drunk, he's useless. Yep. Huh? What's up? Thank you. Because if so, here's your big chance to come out with all the stuff you couldn't say before. Wow. Uzaki. Yeah. Hold on. I see, let me get this straight. Correct. I get that. But you didn't have to come in on your day off, you know. I remember cooking for sure, bringing the stuff to make a shrimp dinner and eating and drinking while we watched movies. Yeah, that shark slammed into that one guy, you know the hero in the third movie who then got reincarnated into some fantasy world and I was like, whoa dude he's crazy strong for some reason. And after that I remember enjoying Sakurai's, pitiful tipsy for a while. Hey. Ah, no. Right? You really are a pain, especially at times like this. Okay, look, I was actually there and I'm saying nothing happened. Yeah. Dunno, I'm trying to remember, but it's also fuzzy. I can't say for sure that I was, I mean I can't say anything for certain. Something good, I think. Of course. Hey, I know. Okay. Hana, it's time to wake up hon. Okay. Okay. Huh? Oh, Uzaki. Morning. No, it's true. If it were always summer, then you and I could spend so much more time together. Sakurai. I mean it didn't, all I was trying to say is that we still have plenty of time before we graduate. Huh? Thank you very much. Don't be shy, you can go ahead and thank me now. Come on loner boy, let's go hang out.\n"
